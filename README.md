## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Olanrewaju Adegoke and I am currently residing in Paris, France. I am a data science and machine learning associate with strong background in pure and applied mathematics, statistics and computer science.
I have strong technical skills in handling simple and complex datasets with the aim of bringing out actionable insights that support decision-making while leveraging on my data science, machine learning, mathematics, and statistical skills and concepts in establishing the attributive, associative and contributive relationships between features and outcome variables.

I am confident in the use of python programming and python libraries like NumPy, Pandas for data wrangling and manipulations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis and insights deep-diving, Sckikit-Learn libraries for machine learning pipelines and algorithms, Pytorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV for image preprocessing and transformation and neural network models for achieving high-end and robust performance. 

I have engaged in many data science and machine learning projects where I have carefully followed the key cadance of steps for a successful data science and machine learning modeling and deployment and they include:
  - Problem Framing
  - Conductiing industry and academic research into the problem
  - Conducting experiments to identify relevant input features
  - Framing of the constructs for input-output models
  - Testing the construct and validation
  - Collection of data or using a secondary annotated data for input features based on validated construct
  - Data preparation, preprocessing and features engineering
  - Model experimentation - Model Architecture and Combination Stacking
  - Model Development
  - Model Performance Improvement and Evaluation
  - Code Optimization
  - Model Deployment Strategy
  - Result Presentation

Also, I have 5+ years of experience in manufacturing finance, production and product costing, inventory management and control, internal control, financial modeling and reporting with a trackable record of achievements in multinationals. Professinally, I have handled multiple projects in finance, business development, innovation and strategy. I managed the design, development, implementation, deployment of an entreprise resource planning software (ERP) - Microsoft Dynamics 365 for production flow tracking in terms of cost, inputs and outputs, process enficiency and stock control.

I will be leveraging on all of these invaluable skills to bring the change and growth your organization is yarning for, I am just a call away!!!.
